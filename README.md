HI Ya'll!

I am a creative idealist from TX with an MBA.
I am venturing into coding and software development. 
I am new to the field and am studying through Free Code Camp. 
My goal is to live life with compassion, to inspire others, and to help make their lives better in all that I do. 
I am excited to get started on projects and work with others to create great work.
